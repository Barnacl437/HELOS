echo ---- 
echo This is a recovered copy of HEL OS in the game High Entropy Challenge, after an information collection.
echo This is an intuitive clone of how it work.
echo In the game, it has a rudimentary GUI, but I'm kinda lazy to do that. (Need some help)
echo This is basically a FreeDOS modding with some smell of UNIX commands. Mouse driver used is CuteMouse.
echo I made it because I felt interested in the OS, by how it mixed a bit UNIX and DOS altogether.
echo Also, this is just a barebone of whatever, you are free to do anything on this.
echo (For graphical support, this doesn't have a graphic driver, perhaps you have to work on your own.)
echo P/S: not completed yet, need more affair.
