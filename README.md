# HELOS
A FreeDOS modding with the inspiration of an operating system called 'HEL OS' from the game High Entropy: Challenges.

## More about this (```osinfo``` content)
 This is a recovered copy of HEL OS in the game High Entropy Challenge, after an information collection.
 This is a visually clone of how it work.
 In the game, it has a rudimentary GUI, but I'm kinda lazy to do that. (Need some help)
 This is basically a FreeDOS modding with some smell of UNIX commands. Mouse driver used is CuteMouse. (I dunno if I've bundled it here yet)
 I made it because I felt interested in the OS, by how it mixed a bit UNIX and DOS altogether.
 Also, this is just a barebone of whatever, you are free to do anything on this.
(For graphical support, this doesn't have a graphic driver, perhaps you have to work on your own.)
 P/S: not completed yet, need more affair.
 
## Note a bit (```atrblist``` quotation)
 This sample of operating system can be done anything on.
 Deployment of the OS on some serious tasks is testing.

## License
NVM that license, I didn't intent to add a license. You are free to do something on this, like what you do with the FreeDOS project and whatever.
