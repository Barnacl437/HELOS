# HELOS
A FreeDOS modding with the inspiration of an operating system called 'HEL OS' from the game [High Entropy: Challenges](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1389630/High_Entropy_Challenges/). Just for fun, and I think I gotta beat this game.
(As of this time, you wouldn't able to see this page unless you're choosen, since this is private.)

## More about this (```osinfo``` content)
 This is a recovered copy of HEL OS in the game High Entropy Challenge, after an information collection.
 This is a visually clone of how it work.
 In the game, it has a rudimentary GUI, but I'm kinda lazy to do that. (Need some help)
 This is basically a FreeDOS modding with some smell of UNIX commands. Mouse driver used is CuteMouse. (I dunno if I've bundled it here yet)
 I made it because I felt interested in the OS, by how it mixed a bit UNIX and DOS altogether.
 Also, this is just a barebone of whatever, you are free to do anything on this.
(For graphical support, this doesn't have a graphic driver, perhaps you have to work on your own.)
 P/S: not completed yet, need more affair.
 
 ## Why DOS, not a Linux kernel?
 Uhhh, perhaps the system commands has the .exe format (but I used .bat instead for easily), so I assume it's mostly DOS-based.
 I'm just a wet step into the UNIX world, so I donno how to write a bash script yet. Beggin' pardon, need your sympathy.
 
 ## Whaddahek does HEL OS just mean?
 It stands for "High Entropy Labs", probably its original developer. The current HEL OS version in the game is 1.15, copyrighted High Entropy Labs in 1994.
 
 ## How to install
 De facto you can't just copy those to a FAT32 formatted disk and see it works. This is an underway work anyways, so I'll gotta tell about this later.
 Curious and wanna tryna bit? You can download the source, copy those to an existing DOS system, whether MS-DOS or FreeDOS, and remember to rename the DOS system folder to ```system``` as defined in the ```autoexec.bat``` file.
 
## Note a bit (```atrblist``` quotation)
 This sample of operating system can be done anything on.
 Deployment of the OS on some serious tasks is testing.

## License
NVM that license, I didn't intent to add a license. You are free to do something on this, like what you do with the FreeDOS project and whatever.
